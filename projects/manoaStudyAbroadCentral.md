Manoa Study Abroad Central is a web application that my group and I developed for our final project, designed to simplify the process of choosing a study abroad or exchange program at UH Manoa. With numerous programs available, students often face confusion and uncertainty. Our platform offers program overviews, peer testimonials, and interactive features like liking and commenting on posts. Users can search and filter posts by program or region. Additionally, an administration panel allows admins to monitor activity, approve or delete posts, remove comments, and flag posts for a seamless user experience.<br>

Throughout the project, my responsibilities included setting up the "Add Post" page, deploying the website to Digital Ocean, configuring the domain name and implementing HTTPS for enhanced security. While initially working on the post submission function, I collaborated with a team member, ultimately adopting their code to streamline development. Additionally, I was responsible for implementing TestCafe to conduct automated testing of all web pages, ensuring a smooth and functional user experience.
