## Discovering JavaScript
<p>Before taking this course, my coding background was primarily in C/C++. However, learning JavaScript was relatively straightforward which made it an easy language to learn. Unlike C/C++, which is mainly used for system programming, JavaScript is geared towards web development. One key difference is that JavaScript uses dynamic typing, while C/C++ uses a static typing system. Additionally, JavaScript takes care of memory management automatically, whereas C/C++ demands manual memory supervision.</p>

## Athletic Software Engineering
<p>Participating in the timed practice WODs (Workout of the Day) for software engineering has been very beneficial. I had never before put myself on the clock while solving short coding challenges. The repeated practice from these timed exercises has really sharpened my coding abilities. Although it can be somewhat stressful to work under a timer, it's a productive form of stress. I believe that this method will serve me well in the long term, especially when I begin searching for a job in the future.</p>

## Conclusion
<p>In conclusion, my introduction to JavaScript has been a valuable experience, expanding my coding skill set beyond C/C++. The language's user-friendly features and self-handling of memory, along with practicing coding under time constraints, have greatly improved my capabilities. These added skills will be very beneficial in the long run.</p>
