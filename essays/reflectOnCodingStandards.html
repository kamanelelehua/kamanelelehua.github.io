<h2 id="navigating-code-more-than-just-rules">Navigating Code: More Than Just Rules</h2>
<p>Coding standards are often thought of as just little rules about how to write code, like where to put a bracket or how many spaces to use. However, I think that coding standards are much more important—they’re like a map that helps you write better code and learn more about programming. Coding standards are especially important when working with others, promoting uniformity and understandability. But even when working alone, following these standards can be incredibly beneficial. They help me avoid common mistakes, keep my code organized, and make it easier to update or modify my work later on. This, in turn, saves time and effort in the long run, making the entire coding process more enjoyable and less stressful.</p>

<h2 id="green-checkmarks">Green Checkmarks</h2>
<p>After using ESLint and IntelliJ for a week, I've started to see how helpful they can be. The installation and set up process was seamless, and the instructions were very straightforward. Using tools like these helps make following coding standards easier. These tools are like helpful teachers, showing us how to write better code in a way that's easy to understand and learn from. Additionally, the auto-correct feature in ESLint has saved me a lot of time. It was handy to have minor mistakes fixed automatically.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In short, coding standards are more than just rules. They’re guides that help us learn, work together, and write better code. ESLint and IntelliJ are valuable tools that help make following these standards straight forward. They might seem tedious at first, but once you get used to them, they become a routine part of coding.</p>
