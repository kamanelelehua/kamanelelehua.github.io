How did I find myself on this journey into software engineering? Ten years ago, in 2011, I had a very different vision for my future. Upon graduating from high school, I was young, naive, and thought I knew what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. My initial career goal was to follow in my older sister's footsteps and pursue a nursing degree. I enrolled in classes at the University of Maui College, received my Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) certificate, completed prerequisite courses for Maui's nursing program, and even worked as a CNA to enhance my application. Yet, life had other plans. Over time, I came to realize that healthcare wasn't the right fit for me. I worked in hospice care for a couple of years, and that left me with a somber outlook on life. The turning point came in 2017 when I became a mother and decided it was time for a career change.

My fiancé and I began exploring new educational pathways, but the question was what should I study next? The University of Maui College, unfortunately, didn't offer a wide range of options outside of nursing, dental hygienist, culinary arts, business, or a few other programs. I dabbled in a few courses and stumbled upon ICS 111, an introductory course on computer science. It was a revelation. I found myself really enjoying the class and material, and it became clear that this was the direction I wanted to pursue. 

After completing as many courses as I could from Maui, the time came for me to transfer to the University of Hawaii at Manoa on the island of Oahu to finish my degree. Now, in my final year, I'm poised to graduate in the spring of 2024. In ICS 314, Software Engineering, I eagerly look forward to immersing myself further in the world of software engineering. My goal is to engage in projects that will refine the skills I'll rely on in my future career. This course represents a vital step in my ongoing journey into the realm of software engineering.
