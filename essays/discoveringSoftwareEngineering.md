How did I find myself on this journey into software engineering? Ten years ago, in 2011, I had a vastly different vision for my future. Graduating high school filled me with a sense of certainty – I had it all figured out. My initial ambition was to follow in my older sister's footsteps and pursue a nursing career, a path I was certain I wanted to go down. I enrolled in classes at the University of Maui College, received my Certified Nursing Assistant certificate, completed prerequisite courses for the highly competitive nursing program, and even worked as a CNA to enhance my application. Yet, life had other plans. Over time, I came to realize that healthcare wasn't the right fit for me. Working in hospice care for a couple of years left me with a somber outlook on life. The turning point came in 2017 when I became a mother and decided it was time for a career change.

My fiancé and I began exploring new educational pathways, but the question was, what should I study next? University of Maui College, unfortunately, didn't offer a wide range of options outside of nursing, dental assisting, culinary arts, or business. I dabbled in a few courses and stumbled upon ICS 111, an introductory course in object-oriented programming. It was a revelation. I found myself completely intrigues in the subject matter, and it became clear that this was the direction I wanted to pursue. 

After completing as many courses as I could from Maui, the time came for me to transfer to the University of Hawaii at Manoa on the island of Oahu to finish my degree. Now, in my final year, I'm poised to graduate in the spring of 2024. In ICS 314, Software Engineering, I eagerly look forward to immersing myself further in the world of software engineering. My goal is to engage in projects that will refine the skills I'll rely on in my future career. This course represents a vital step in my ongoing journey into the realm of software engineering.
